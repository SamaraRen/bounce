Robotic tasks such as localization, navigation, coverage, and monitoring can be
expressed as properties of the robot's path through space. For example, to
monitor environmental conditions in a greenhouse, we may want a robot which
patrols the space along a repeatable path. We would like to automatically design
such paths, while requiring minimal sensing and control on the robot. We note
that commercially available robots are able to travel forward in straight lines,
stop at boundaries, and turn in place upon reaching such a boundary. Using
simple sensors such as proximity detectors, such robots can measure and control
their heading angle with respect to environment boundaries. Thus, we are
inspired to use billiards and related models to analyse such robotic systems. In
particular, we consider robots which always leave a boundary at an angle which
is fixed with respect to the normal. This dynamical system is similar to the
recently investigated "microorganism billiards" system, but with no sliding
along the boundary and the assumption of controllability of the departure angle.
Our main result is the existence and exact solutions of stable limit cycles in
all convex polygons. For some ranges of departure angles, chaotic dynamics
result, and we will show some analysis of these dynamics. We will also show some
preliminary ideas for path characterization and synthesis in nonconvex polygons.
